### The Goal

``ReactGate`` provides a backend-indipendent solution, you can even choose not to use backend at all.

This library provides a React component called Gate, as the name suggest, you can use the component to deny the access to certain parts of your application according to provided configuration.

The package was thought to be frankly declarative and easy to set up.
